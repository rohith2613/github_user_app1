# GitHub User Explorer

GitHub User Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore GitHub profiles and repositories.

## Overview

The application is built with React and uses the GitHub API to fetch user information and repositories. It consists of two main pages:

1. **User Page:** Displays basic information about a GitHub user, such as their profile picture, username, followers, following, public repositories, and join date. Users can navigate to the user's GitHub profile from this page.

2. **Repository List Page:** Lists the public repositories of a GitHub user, displaying repository names, descriptions, stars, and forks. Pagination is implemented to allow users to navigate through the repositories.
